## Tasks todo

    
    1. Lint our JavaScript. (Seriously. Do it.)
    2. Compile our Sass files. (Browsers canâ€™t read that stuff...)
    3. Concatenate our JavaScript. (Reduce HTTP Requests!)
    4. Minify and rename concatenated files. (Every little bit counts!)

## Run

    gulp or gulp default
